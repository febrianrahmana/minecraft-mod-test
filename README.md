# Fabric Mod Test

## Context

This repository was made to experiment in Minecraft modding using Fabric. Since I'm hosting a minecraft server using Fabric on AWS EC2, I needed a way to automatically shut down the server when there are no players around.

## Feature

Currently planned features are to create a 10 minute(ish) timer at 0 players online that will call the API to turn off the server.
